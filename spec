Polyphon-NG

A procedural music generator based on experience with Polyphon and Polyphon Orchestral.

Key new ideas:
Explicit chords: as well as knowing what key we're in, we also have a defined chord that we're in.
Explicit phrasing, combined with chord sequences.
'Fragments' - we generate a polyphonic stream, then extract a melodic line, then produce a sequence of chords to accompany it, then use that to generate a new polyphonic stream around it; we can also repeat the melodic fragment, or the chord sequence, later; perhaps even producing things like sonata form.
